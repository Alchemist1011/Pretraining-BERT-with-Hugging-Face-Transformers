## BERT Pretraining from Scratch
his project demonstrates the pretraining of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) from scratch using the WikiText English dataset. BERT is a state-of-the-art model that utilizes a Transformer architecture to learn the contextual relationships between words in a text sequence.

### Key Features
Transformer-based Architecture: BERT leverages the encoder mechanism of the Transformer to understand bidirectional context. 

Masked Language Modeling (MLM): 15% of the input words are masked, and BERT predicts the original words based on surrounding context.

Next Sentence Prediction (NSP): The model is trained to predict if two input sentences are sequential or randomly paired.

Fine-tuning for NLP Tasks: The pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned for tasks like text classification, question answering, and more.

### Usage
Pretraining: The model is trained using the WikiText dataset.
Fine-tuning: After pretraining, the model can be fine-tuned on a downstream NLP task.

The BERT model is optimized to learn rich, bidirectional language representations, making it ideal for tasks requiring deep contextual understanding.
